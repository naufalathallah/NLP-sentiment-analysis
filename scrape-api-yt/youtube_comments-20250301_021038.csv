"I&#39;ve heard his name getting popular on internet lately, i don&#39;t know him but PewDiePie name seems familiar to me, i didn&#39;t know that he&#39;s the one who make the bit*h lasagna song, this always hypes me when I&#39;m on school"
6 years ago is crazy 🥲
The one unironacly good Youtuber song.
"I love ts song! 😂 Yup, definitely deserves an updoot from me! This is some reddit gold!! 🤣🤣"
My homeroom teacher accidentally clicked on this…. She’s old and didn’t know what it was so she kept watching thinking she was going to get up to date with kids or smth
It reminds me of lasagna but my brother ate it

Yo no entendía lo que decía porque en ese momento no sabía inglés, pero me gustaba mucho el ritmo 👍 ahora me salió en recomendados y reviví los mejores 3 años de mi vida (entre todos los fandoms en los que estuve, el creepypastero fue el mejor por mucho) 🥸"

It’s disgusting that YouTube India decided to hide this video from the Indians. I’ve gotta use a VPN to listen to, &amp; enjoy this masterpiece of a song. It’s timeless. I’ll still keep coming back here, years later. PewDiePie is the real king. I’m whole-heartedly ready to hate on T-Series, any day of the week."

You all remember the Pewdiepie v T series race to 100mil subs?
The American Sign Language caption goes hard 💀💀💀
6years later still a bop
The first person to watch this probably got hyped
Mr beast is not winning against prime pewdiepie
Better than KSI
Son of P.Diddy
Tbh pewdiepie never lost n never was in danger. He is still the most subscribed YouTuber that’s NOT a COMPANY! T-Series is a company. Mr beast is a company. Pewdiepie is still the most subscribed YouTuber (in my books. Im not very updated so if someone has beat him and isn’t a company then I’m not aware of it)
Somone 2024? Still banger tho
Anyone here in October 2024?

There are delusional Redditors who are trying to be revisionists and say that Pewdiepie vs. T-Series was because Pewds was racist. Don’t let them succeed.  We were against T-Series bc T-Series was a big corporation. Not because it was from India.
