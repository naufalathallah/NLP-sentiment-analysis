Why do i have the feeling that YouTube is gonna recommend me this in 7 years..
Felix's son has one of the craziest dad lores ever.
Pewdiepies first subscriber must feel like the king of the world
"Man recreated this with his son after 6 years... It was a joy to be part of this era, thanks, Felix."
Imagine going to the beach one day and seeing a grown man yelling bitc  lasagna
"I remember when the comment section was normal, not a calendar"
"Ah yes,the greatest war in history,sorry to everyone who wasn't able to see it"
IT WAS 6 YEARS AGO????
J√∂rgen would have been so proud to see this
I like how when I'm 80 I can tell 9 year olds I was alive during this great war
"A Swedish man who plays Minecraft 
Still gets more views than a billion dollar company"

This is like the king of sweden and the king of australia
what a classic. better than I remember ngl
Man this was a vibe.
I miss the days when this was the height of internet rivalry
This was a prime pewdiepie
TS So Ô∏èOI certified
Anyone else in 2025
thanks for the recommendation
american sign language subtitles really made me cry from this masterpiece
This was hard asf at its time
"6 years and youtube recommended me this masterpiece 
it felt like yesterday for real 
we are getting old 
is youtube trying to tell me something ?"
I SAID I‚ÄôD NEVER RETURN HERE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
boi ts friggin tuff
My sister called u pewed
7 years and it's still a great song
Boiii TS ƒ∞S TUFF
World heritage video
Popped out of nowhere
Holy shit this aged like milk
The fact that this video has more comments than the crazy frog music video is crazy
Ts was so tuff when it came out
i remember sing this when i was a kid
Damn it's been 6 years  Time has flown by so fast
Seeing this after 6 years proves that pewdiepie really won the battle
"I remember returning home from school and going on youtube to check the subscriber count, good times man"
Youtube just recommended this to me after so long XD
Can't believe this was 5 YEARS AGO like bro I remember this youtube war happening yesterday
"goes into captions out of curiosity

sees american sign language




IM CRYING LMFAOOO"
officially the most viewed youtuber song ever!!!!
Im getting suggested this in 2025
6 years ago this is making me feel olddd
I really love youtube algorithm
I was part of the 9-Year-Old Army
And this dude has son right now xD magnificent
Boiii ts so frickin dank
I just took out oven my first lasagna and instantly turned in this song...
Just got this recommended lmao
The one unironacly good Youtuber song.
As an adult all i can imagine is him sending the lyric sheet to his lawyer who had to look over this to make sure he couldnt be sued for posting this
Why is this still a banger
Had to re-watch the original after the B- lasagna Ft. Bjorn remake dropped
This is still an anthem in 2025
I was proud to be in the 9 year old army
"And He's recreated it
with Bjorn! 6 years is crazy"
It's about time that youtube had to recommend this again
I can't believe its almost 2026.
"Today feb 14, 2025 he uploaded a video of them back in Brighton beach and he was singing this song with Bj√∂rn. An alternate version of course but it was adorable"
Welcome back after all these years
this was so racist and we all loved it
Bro makes a good diss track and still loses
"When I eat lasagna, I have this song in my head"
ASL subtitles are really amazing it cured my cancer
Who's watching on February 2025 ?
What is going on with this book review club?????? We Already in FEB lol
Bruh this is crazy 5 years ago feels like yesterday
This slaps hard af
"Bro, believe it or not, but in 6 years from now on, you'll visit this beach again with your son."
"Anyone here in 2025? Im here, just watching this video again from youtube recommended. I missed this old days"
I REMEMBER THIS SONG
I witnessed this war
YouTube recommend this to me in 2025
YouTube really recommended this to me in 2025

Senzawa brought me here.
He‚Äôs a complete different person because the kid
I still can't believe that people thought and still think that this video was a racist thing to do.
"Holy moly it's been seven years and I've never heard of Tv series again. Guess he really did go through them like a bullet, huh? They picked fights with Eminem and Pewdipie. At some point it's just the law of stupid elimination."
My homeroom teacher accidentally clicked on this‚Ä¶. She‚Äôs old and didn‚Äôt know what it was so she kept watching thinking she was going to get up to date with kids or smth
Bjorn finna be roasting t-series like his dad.
Everytime I listen to this I‚Äôm so proud  go pewdie
how does it feel
I had to come and give this a listen since it had been awhile and randomly came to my head whilst eating my mother in laws homemade lasagne which just isnt very good
"youtube reccommended me this after like 6 (almost 7) yrs, still feels like yesterday"
This was 6 years ago ffffffuuuuu
Anyone in 2025? genuine question lol
