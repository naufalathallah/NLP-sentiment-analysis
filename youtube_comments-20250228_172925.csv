"Man recreated this with his son after 6 years... It was a joy to be part of this era, thanks, Felix."
Imagine going to the beach one day and seeing a grown man yelling bitc  lasagna
"I remember when the comment section was normal, not a calendar"
"Ah yes,the greatest war in history,sorry to everyone who wasn't able to see it"
IT WAS 6 YEARS AGO????
Jörgen would have been so proud to see this
I like how when I'm 80 I can tell 9 year olds I was alive during this great war

Popped out of nowhere
Holy shit this aged like milk
The fact that this video has more comments than the crazy frog music video is crazy
Ts was so tuff when it came out
i remember sing this when i was a kid
Damn it's been 6 years  Time has flown by so fast
Seeing this after 6 years proves that pewdiepie really won the battle
"I remember returning home from school and going on youtube to check the subscriber count, good times man"
Youtube just recommended this to me after so long XD
Can't believe this was 5 YEARS AGO like bro I remember this youtube war happening yesterday
"goes into captions out of curiosity

sees american sign language




IM CRYING LMFAOOO"
officially the most viewed youtuber song ever!!!!
Im getting suggested this in 2025
6 years ago this is making me feel olddd
I really love youtube algorithm
I was part of the 9-Year-Old Army
And this dude has son right now xD magnificent
Boiii ts so frickin dank
I just took out oven my first lasagna and instantly turned in this song...
Just got this recommended lmao
The one unironacly good Youtuber song.
As an adult all i can imagine is him sending the lyric sheet to his lawyer who had to look over this to make sure he couldnt be sued for posting this
Why is this still a banger
Had to re-watch the original after the B- lasagna Ft. Bjorn remake dropped
This is still an anthem in 2025
I was proud to be in the 9 year old army
"And He's recreated it
with Bjorn! 6 years is crazy"
It's about time that youtube had to recommend this again
I can't believe its almost 2026.
"Today feb 14, 2025 he uploaded a video of them back in Brighton beach and he was singing this song with Björn. An alternate version of course but it was adorable"
Welcome back after all these years
this was so racist and we all loved it
Bro makes a good diss track and still loses
"When I eat lasagna, I have this song in my head"
ASL subtitles are really amazing it cured my cancer
Who's watching on February 2025 ?
What is going on with this book review club?????? We Already in FEB lol
Bruh this is crazy 5 years ago feels like yesterday
This slaps hard af
"Bro, believe it or not, but in 6 years from now on, you'll visit this beach again with your son."
"Anyone here in 2025? Im here, just watching this video again from youtube recommended. I missed this old days"
I REMEMBER THIS SONG
I witnessed this war
YouTube recommend this to me in 2025
YouTube really recommended this to me in 2025
2025?
2025 година? Тук ли сме???
Senzawa brought me here.
He’s a complete different person because the kid
I still can't believe that people thought and still think that this video was a racist thing to do.
"Holy moly it's been seven years and I've never heard of Tv series again. Guess he really did go through them like a bullet, huh? They picked fights with Eminem and Pewdipie. At some point it's just the law of stupid elimination."
My homeroom teacher accidentally clicked on this…. She’s old and didn’t know what it was so she kept watching thinking she was going to get up to date with kids or smth
Bjorn finna be roasting t-series like his dad.
Everytime I listen to this I’m so proud  go pewdie
how does it feel
I had to come and give this a listen since it had been awhile and randomly came to my head whilst eating my mother in laws homemade lasagne which just isnt very good
"youtube reccommended me this after like 6 (almost 7) yrs, still feels like yesterday"
This was 6 years ago ffffffuuuuu
Anyone in 2025? genuine question lol

"Great recommendation after 6 years, been part of it, feeling proud and nostalgic xd"
